# CSRCE
CSRCE - CSharpRemoteCodeExecution
Allows you to remotely execute code on a target computer.
Like a rat, **__NO WAY DO I CONDONE RATTING/INFECTING COMPUTERS YOU DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO DO SO!__**

## Whats the purpose?
This is just showing how it's done, while running the client it tells the user what it does, so really, its just showing you how.

## How does it work?
Well you just drag'n'drop a cs file (csharp source code file) on the CSRCE Server (doesn't support much other then console applications, and is limited to 1 file, meaning you could do stuff with nested classes)   
And then run the client, enter y, then it will get the code, and run it through memory.

## Whats its use
Well mostly this is used for a download payload, basicily, downloads code, that code downloads an exe, runs exe, bAM ratted or somethin.

## Sample source code?
Its in the releases tab.
